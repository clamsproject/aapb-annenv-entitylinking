# ELA - Entity Link Annotator

This annotator takes as input a set of files with Brat annotations and a set of source files, and creates an output file `data/annotations.tab` with entity links. It is geared towards defining Wikipedia links for named entities in an annotation.

For installation see the documentation in [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

At the moment this tool is a bit of a one-trick pony in that it only works with named entity annotations for the CLAMS project using the Brat annotation tool.
